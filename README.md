## 📘 Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class 🏗️

### Task
- Create a class representing anything you like (Smartphone, Book, Superhero, etc.).
- Add attributes and methods to bring the class to life.
- Use a constructor to initialize unique values for each object.
- Add inheritance to explore polymorphism or encapsulation.

### Expected Outcome
- A Python class with meaningful attributes and methods.
- Demonstration of inheritance and object creation.
- Example output showing the class in action.

## 🎭 Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge

### Task
- Create a program with animals or vehicles.
- Each class should include the same action (like `move()`).
- Show how each class behaves differently (e.g., `Car.move()` → "Driving", `Plane.move()` → "Flying").

### Expected Outcome
- Multiple classes sharing the same method name.
- Each class prints a unique result when the method is called.
- A demonstration loop that shows polymorphism in action.
